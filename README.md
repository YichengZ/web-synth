# 🧪 AI Synth Lab (Web Audio Experiments)

Welcome to my digital audio laboratory. This repository hosts a collection of browser-based synthesizers, effects, and DSP tools.

**What makes this special?**
Every line of DSP (Digital Signal Processing) code and UI logic in this project was generated by AI, guided by my prompt engineering and sound design expertise. It's an exploration of human-AI collaboration in audio tool development.
